# ✸ study notes 📖

this repository contains my **personal study notes**, jupyter notebooks, and exploratory experiments across various areas of programming and computer science.

the goal is to create a clean, organized space to document concepts, practice implementations, and **track my learning progress** over time. so that I can revisit and expand as I learn.


## ✮ topics studied so far 
* Machine Learning
  * Clustering
    * K-Means

## ✮ organization style
each major topic has its own dedicated folder.

each folder may contain:
* a `README.md` with an overview of the topic
* a `notes.md` file with notes, theoretical explanations and insights
* jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) with experiments and implementations

### naming pattern:
* topic_description.ipynb
* example: kmeans_clustering.ipynb
