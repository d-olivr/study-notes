# ✸ kmeans 
this repository contains my study materials + experiments on the kmeans algorithm, a method for clustering in unsupervised machine learning.

## ★ objectives
* understand step-by-step how the kmeans algorithm works.
* explore preprocessing, scaling, and choosing an optimal number of clusters.
* isualize clusters in order to identify patterns in data.
